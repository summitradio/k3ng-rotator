For an azimuth-only system or an azimuth/elevation system with minimal features, an Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, or similar variants, or an ATMega328 chip will have enough memory.  The code has been tested on an Arduino Mega and Mega ADK.  If you plan to use the master/slave functionality, you will need an Arduino Mega or Mega ADK, or an ATMega1284 or ATMMega2560 chip in order to have a second serial port.  The remote slave unit can run on an Uno or an ATMega328 chip.
