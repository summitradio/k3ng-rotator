Rotary encoders can be enabled with these feature defines:

`#define FEATURE_AZ_POSITION_ROTARY_ENCODER`

`#define FEATURE_EL_POSITION_ROTARY_ENCODER`

Additionally, you need to configure the rotary encoder pins here:

`#define az_rotary_position_pin1 0`

`#define az_rotary_position_pin2 0`

`#define el_rotary_position_pin1 0`

`#define el_rotary_position_pin2 0`

Replace the zeros with your pin numbers.  There are no restrictions on the pin assignments.

The last thing you need to do is set the amount of azimuthal or elevation heading change per rotary encoder pulse:

`#define AZ_POSITION_ROTARY_ENCODER_DEG_PER_PULSE 0.5`
`#define EL_POSITION_ROTARY_ENCODER_DEG_PER_PULSE 0.5`

Note that these options related to rotary encoder position sensors are enabled by default in the code:

`#define OPTION_AZ_POSITION_ROTARY_ENCODER_HARD_LIMIT `

`#define OPTION_EL_POSITION_ROTARY_ENCODER_HARD_LIMIT `
