All features and options are configured in the Features and Options section of the code **in the rotator_features.h file**.  Various #defines need to be enabled by uncommenting them (by removing double slashes "//") or disabled by commenting them out (prefixing with double slashes "//").  After the appropriate features and options are configured, compile the code, upload to your Arduino, and test.
