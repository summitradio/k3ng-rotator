## Overlap LED

To activate the Overlap LED line, change the 0 (zero) in this line to whatever pin you wish to use:

`#define overlap_led 0`

To disable, set the pin to 0.  The Overlap LED will be activated whenever the azimuth is greater than the rotator 
starting (fully CCW) azimuth.

## Park LED

This pin goes high when the rotation system has been parked.

`#define parked_pin 0  `

## Park In Progress LED

This pin will go high when there is a rotation park operation in progress.

`#define park_in_progress_pin 0 `

## Serial Activity LED

If defined this pin will go high when there is serial control port activity.

`#define serial_led 0 `

## Run LED

This pin will alternate high and low when the system is running and can be used to drive an LED.  This can be useful on headless units that lack an LCD display or serial port control, or remote slave units.

`#define blink_led 0`

## GPS Sync LED

This pin when defined will go high when GPS tracking is enabled and there is a valid satellite fix. 

`#define gps_sync 0`

## Moon Tracking LED

This pin goes high when moon tracking is activated (regardless of moon visibility).

`#define moon_tracking_active_pin 0 `

## Sun Tracking LED

This pin goes high when sun tracking is activated (regardless of sun visibility).

`#define sun_tracking_active_pin 13 `

## Heading Analog Output Pins

Two pins are available to driving analog meters for azimuth and elevation headings.  This is activated with:

`#define FEATURE_ANALOG_OUTPUT_PINS`

The pins are defined in this section of code:

`#define pin_analog_az_out 0`

`#define pin_analog_el_out 0`

Additionally, the corresponding elevation voltage maximum can be set in the rotator_setting.h file:

`#define ANALOG_OUTPUT_MAX_EL_DEGREES 180`
