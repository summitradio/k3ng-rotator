Currently several types of position sensors are supported:
* Potentiometer / Analog Voltage Inputs
* Rotary Encoder
* Pulse
* ADXL345 Accelerometer
* HMC5883L digital compass
* LSM303 digital compass and accelerometer

You can mix and match azimuth and elevation sensors.  For example, you can use a potentiometer for the azimuth and an ADXL345 accelerometer for the elevation.  Aren't choices great?
