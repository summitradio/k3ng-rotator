Language customization is supported for the LCD display.  Currently these languages are available:

`#define LANGUAGE_ENGLISH`

`#define LANGUAGE_SPANISH`

`#define LANGUAGE_CZECH `

`#define LANGUAGE_ITALIAN`

`#define LANGUAGE_PORTUGUESE_BRASIL`

Language customization support may be added in the future for the command line interface.  Weâ€™re looking for volunteers to create more translations!
