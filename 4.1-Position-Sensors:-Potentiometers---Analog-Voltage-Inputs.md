Most installations will use potentiometers as these are used in all mainstream commercial rotators (including Yaesu) and is often the easiest solution to implement in homebrew rotators.  If you are using a commercial rotator and are interfacing with a rotator control unit that outputs an analog voltage for the azimuth (like the Yaesu G Series), this is the option you want to use.  Potentiometer position sensors are activated with these lines:

`#define FEATURE_AZ_POSITION_POTENTIOMETER`

`#define FEATURE_EL_POSITION_POTENTIOMETER`

The input pins for potentiometer / voltage sensors are defined here:

`#define rotator_analog_az A0`

`#define rotator_analog_el 0`

You must use an analog capable pin such as A0, A1, A2, etc.  The input expects 0 to 5 volts, with 0 volts being fully counterclockwise (CCW) and 5 volts fully clockwise (CW).  (For elevation, 0 volts equates to 0 degrees, 5 volts equals 180 degrees or any maximum elevation you choose.)  The Yaesu G series rotator controllers output this voltage.

Note that if you have an azimuth only rotator, you do not need to define anything associated with elevation, and disabling `FEATURE_ELEVATION_CONTROL` will cause all elevation related parameters and features to be ignored at compile and run time.

To activate use of the Arduino/AVR analog reference pin for any analog readings (i.e. azimuth and elevation potentiometer sensors), activate `OPTION_EXTERNAL_ANALOG_REFERENCE`.  This can be used to increase the accuracy of readings by tieing the analog reference pin to the +5 volt line.
