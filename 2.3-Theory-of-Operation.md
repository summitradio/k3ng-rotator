The rotator controller reads the azimuth (and elevation if optioned) from a sensor and reports the headings via a serial interface  called the control port, when queried.  The controller rotates the azimuth and elevation when commanded via the control port.  The controller can be commanded for manual rotation (left, right, up, and down) or be commanded to rotate to a target azimuth and elevation.  An LCD display can be optioned to display headings and various status messages.  Human interface controls such as buttons, potentiometers, and rotary encoders can be added to control rotation.  The control port can also be accessed via an Ethernet port using TCP/IP.
