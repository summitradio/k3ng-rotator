The ADXL345 accelerometer can be used for elevation readings.

Two libraries are supported, the [Adafruit library](https://blog.adafruit.com/2013/03/26/tutorial-adxl345-digital-accelerometer-the-adafruit-learning-system/) and the Love Electronics library.  Pick one or the other, but not both.  Either one works fine.

To use the Adafruit library, uncomment this line:

`#define FEATURE_EL_POSITION_ADXL345_USING_ADAFRUIT_LIB`

To use the Love Electronics library, uncomment this line:

`#define FEATURE_EL_POSITION_ADXL345_USING_LOVE_ELECTRON_LIB`

The ADXL345 device is interfaced with the Arduino or ATMega chip via the I2C bus. [Consult this for more information on I2C.](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire)

Note: that the accelerometer responds by rotating the sensor about the X axis.
