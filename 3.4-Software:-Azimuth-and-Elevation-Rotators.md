To activate the elevation functionality, uncomment this line in the code and recompile:

`#define FEATURE_ELEVATION_CONTROL`

If you are using this unit for an azimuth-only rotator, you can omit the following components: R6, Q3, C5, R7, Q4, C6, C2, R3, S3, and S4.

(Throughout this documentation you will often see elevation mentioned.  If you have an azimuth-only rotator, rest assured that all functionality is supported for azimuth-only rotators and the code works equally well for azimuth-only and azimuth/elevation rotators.)
